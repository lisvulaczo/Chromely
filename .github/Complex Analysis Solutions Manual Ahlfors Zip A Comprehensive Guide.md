## What is Complex Analysis?
  
Complex analysis is a branch of mathematics that studies functions of complex numbers, which are numbers of the form `a + bi`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers and `i` is the imaginary unit that satisfies `i^2 = -1`. Complex numbers can be represented as points on a plane called the complex plane, where the horizontal axis is the real part and the vertical axis is the imaginary part. Complex analysis deals with topics such as complex differentiation, integration, series, residues, conformal mapping, analytic continuation, and Riemann surfaces.
  
Complex analysis has many applications in physics, engineering, cryptography, number theory, and other areas of mathematics. For example, complex analysis can be used to solve differential equations that arise in fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and relativity. Complex analysis can also help to prove important results such as the prime number theorem, the Riemann hypothesis, and Fermat's last theorem.
  
## Why Ahlfors' Book?
  
Lars Valerian Ahlfors was a Finnish mathematician who was one of the leading experts in complex analysis in the 20th century. He won the Fields Medal in 1936 for his work on Riemann surfaces and conformal geometry. He also wrote several influential books on complex analysis, including his classic textbook "Complex Analysis: An Introduction to the Theory of Analytic Functions of One Complex Variable", first published in 1953.
  
Ahlfors' book is widely regarded as one of the best introductions to complex analysis for undergraduate and graduate students. It covers all the essential topics in a clear and rigorous way, with many examples and exercises. The book also contains some advanced material that can be used for further study or research. Some of the topics covered in the book are:
  
- Complex numbers and elementary functions
- Complex differentiation and Cauchy-Riemann equations
- Power series and analytic functions
- Complex integration and Cauchy's theorem
- Singularities and Laurent series
- Residue theorem and applications
- Conformal mapping and Schwarz-Christoffel formula
- Harmonic functions and Dirichlet problem
- Riemann mapping theorem and Riemann surfaces
- Picard's theorem and Nevanlinna theory

Ahlfors' book is not only a textbook but also a masterpiece of mathematical exposition. It has inspired generations of students and researchers in complex analysis and related fields.
  
## How to Download and Use the Solutions Manual?
  
If you are using Ahlfors' book for your course or self-study, you might want to check your answers or get some hints for solving the exercises. Unfortunately, there is no official solutions manual for Ahlfors' book. However, there is an unofficial solutions manual written by Dustin Smith, a former student of Ahlfors at Harvard University. Smith wrote the solutions manual as a personal project to improve his understanding of complex analysis. He later shared it online for other students to use.
  
The solutions manual contains detailed solutions to all the exercises in the third edition of Ahlfors' book (the latest edition). The solutions are written in a clear and concise way, with explanations and references to relevant sections of the book. The solutions manual also includes some additional exercises that Smith created or collected from other sources.
  
The solutions manual is available as a PDF
